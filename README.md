## Issues
Beginning of the project went pretty smooth, it wasn't until I had to comapre the clicked box to the loaded random number that I got confised because no matter what I did, even if the numbers matched, the code said that it was a "loss". After speaking with professor Warrick I realized the if else statement needed to be placed within the AddEventListener code. 

Also struggled with initial setup of the addEventListener because I've never coded anything like that before.
